# Work-Day-Scheduler-Alex-Flaherty


## Description
My intention with this project was to create a calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of their working day. The application runs in the browser and dynamically updates the HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The site is deployed [here.](https://pazoraf.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler-Alex-Flaherty/)
